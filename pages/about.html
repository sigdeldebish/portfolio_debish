                <a>
                    With over 5 years of backend development experience, I've honed my technical skills and 
                    developed a keen eye for solving complex problems. Beyond code, I'm an avid adventurer at 
                    heart - from mountain biking and rock climbing to canoeing, if it gets the adrenaline pumping, 
                    I'm there. My love for travel and exploration drives me to seek out new experiences and landscapes, 
                    often spending free time camping in uncharted territories. <br/>
                    <br/>I'm an extrovert who thrives on social 
                    interactions, whether it's meeting new people, enjoying live music at bars, or just soaking in the 
                    vibrant energy of social gatherings. Married to my wonderful partner of over 7 years, we share a 
                    love for adventure, community, and making lasting memories together. My life is a blend of 
                    professional dedication and personal passion, always open to new experiences and connections.

                <h2>Academic</h2>
                <a>
                    Navigating through an extensive academic path, I've had the privilege of studying at multiple esteemed 
                    institutions, starting with the University of Texas at Arlington in Computer Science, followed by an 
                    enriching experience at Austin Community College where I earned my Associate's degree. My academic 
                    pursuit took me next to Texas State University, and eventually, the shift to online learning during 
                    the pandemic led me to Arizona State University. At ASU, I am part of the pioneering 4+1 degree program 
                    in Information Technology, a testament to my commitment to excel both in my undergraduate and graduate 
                    studies simultaneously. <br/>
                    <br/>Despite the transitions, each institution has contributed to my deep understanding 
                    of computer science, enabling me to develop benchmarking software for processors and write optimized code 
                    in C++ and Java. These achievements highlight not just my academic dedication but also my practical 
                    proficiency in leveraging computer science principles. Moreover, I have had a chance to attend a couple of software engineering 
                    and coding bootcamps where I got to learn how the IT and development is done in a real world scenario to solve real world problems.
